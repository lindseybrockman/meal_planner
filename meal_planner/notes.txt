How this thaaang gon' work

add a bunch of recipes
maybe add some pics
select time frame (1 day, a couple days, a week)
output grocery list

User Workflow:
- Setting
  > User can add a recipe
  > User can add approximated cost of ingredients
  > User has a pantry

- Getting
  > User can ask for a randomized meal plan for a specified time frame (ie day, week)
  > User can request a meal plan that factors in ingredients in the pantry

Datamodel:
Recipe
-title
-prep time
-cook time
-instructions
-ingredient M2M

Ingredient
-name
-measurement M2M

Measurement
-numeric
-type
IE 1 cup, 1.5 tbs

On creation of a recipe, an ingredient is created w/ an association to a measurement



Meals:
meals should comprise of a main dish and one or two sides

Timing:
total time should incorporate prep and cook time
if a side has a prep time < cook time of the main dish, the total time would be:
main dish cooktime + main dish prep time + side cook time (cook methods will be shown, user can decide if they can be cooked simultaneously)

Future Development:
factoring in nutrition info would be awesome
nutrition info could lead to balanced meal planning
pantry should be updated when meals are consumed
